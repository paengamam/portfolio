        <p>[Verse 1]<br>
        Risin' up, back on the street<br>
        Did my time, took my chances<br>
        Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet<br>
        Just a man and his will to survive</p>

        <p>[Chorus]<br>
        It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight<br>
        Risin' up to the challenge of our rival<br>
        And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night<br>
        And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger</p>

        <p>[Verse 2]<br>
        Face to face, out in the heat<br>
        Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry<br>
        They stack the odds till we take to the street<br>
        For the kill with the skill to survive</p>

        <p>[Chorus]<br>
        It's the eye of the tiger...</p>

        <p>[Verse 3]<br>
        Risin' up, straight to the top...</p>

        <p>[Chorus]<br>
        It's the eye of the tiger...</p>

        <p>[Outro]<br>
        The eye of the tiger<br>
        The eye of the tiger<br>
        The eye of the tiger<br>
        The eye of the tiger</p>
